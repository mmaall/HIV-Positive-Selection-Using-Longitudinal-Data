CRWN 89: HIV Positive Selection
===============================

Collaborators: Kevin Hu, Tiana Pereria, Michael Lanthier

Drug resistance is a continuing problem when treating HIV/AIDS. Because of the very high mutation rates of HIV, drug resistance is developed extremely quickly. In order to best treat HIV, being able to identify mutations associated with drug resistance is extremely important. Through the use of a longitudinal data set of 1,700 patients, we performed analysis of HIV reverse transcriptase to identify positively selected positions that may incur drug resistance.

The program runs in Python 3. Backwards compatability is not guaranteed.
